<FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Thesis title</I>: "<B>Topics in G<SUB>2</SUB> geometry and geometric flows</B>"</FONT>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Thesis abstract</I>: We study three different problems in this thesis, all related to G<SUB>2</SUB> structures and geometric flows. In the first problem we study hypersurfaces in a nearly G<SUB>2</SUB> manifold. We define various quantities associated to such a hypersurface using the G<SUB>2</SUB> structure of the ambient manifold and establish several relations between them. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a hypersurface with an almost complex structure induced from the G<SUB>2</SUB> structure of the ambient manifold to be nearly Kaehler. Then using the nearly G<SUB>2</SUB> structure on the round sphere S<SUP>7</SUP>, we prove that for a compact minimal hypersurface M<SUP>6</SUP> of constant scalar curvature in S<SUP>7</SUP> with the shape operator A satisfying |A|<SUP>2</SUP> > 6, there exists an eigenvalue &lambda; > 12 of the Laplace operator on M such that |A|<SUP>2</SUP> = &lambda; - 6, thus giving the next discrete value of |A|<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 0 and 6 in terms of the spectrum of the Laplace operator on M. The latter is related to a question of Chern on the values of the scalar curvature of compact minimal hypersurfaces in S<SUP>n</SUP> of constant scalar curvature.</P>

<P>The second problem is related to the study of solitons and almost solitons of the Ricci-Bourguignon flow. We prove some characterization results for compact Ricci-Bourguignon solitons. Taking motivation from Ricci almost solitons, we then introduce the notion of Ricci-Bourguignon almost solitons and prove some results about them which generalize previous results for Ricci almost solitons. We also derive integral formulas for compact gradient Ricci-Bourguignon solitons and compact gradient Ricci-Bourguignon almost solitons. Finally, using the integral formula we show that a compact gradient Ricci-Bourguignon al- most soliton is isometric to an Euclidean sphere if it has constant scalar curvature or if its associated vector field is conformal.</P>

<P>In the third problem we study a flow of G<SUB>2</SUB> structures that all induce the same Riemannian metric. This isometric flow is the negative gradient flow of an energy functional. We prove Shi-type estimates for the torsion tensor T along the flow. We show that at a finite-time singularity the torsion must blow up, so the flow will exist as long as the torsion remains bounded. We prove a Cheeger-Gromov type compactness theorem for the flow. One possible motivation for studying this isometric flow of G<SUB>2</SUB>-structures is that it can be coupled with "Ricci flow" of G<SUB>2</SUB> structures, which is a flow of G<SUB>2</SUB> structures that induces precisely the Ricci flow on metrics, in contrast to the Laplacian flow which induces Ricci flow plus lower order terms involving the torsion. In effect, one may hope to first flow the 3-form in a way that improves the metric, and then flow the 3-form in a way that preserves the metric but still decreases the torsion. More generally, the isometric flow is a particular geometric flow of G<SUB>2</SUB>-structures distinct from the Laplacian flow, and both fit into a broader class of geometric flows of G<SUB>2</SUB>-structures with good analytic properties. In the final section, we summarize the rest of the results on the isometric flow which include an Uhlenbeck type trick and the definition of a scale-invariant quantity &Theta; for any solution of the flow and the proof that it is almost monotonic along the flow. We also introduce an entropy functional and prove that low entropy initial data lead to solutions of the flow that exist for all time and converge smoothly to a G<SUB>2</SUB> structure with divergence-free torsion. We study the singular set of the flow. Finally, we prove that if the singularity is of Type-I then a sequence of blow-ups of a solution admits a subsequence that converges to a shrinking soliton for the flow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Thesis abstract</I>: We introduce the notion of a weak (homotopy) moment map associated to a Lie group action on a multisymplectic manifold. We show that the existence/uniqueness theory governing these maps is a direct generalization from symplectic geometry. We use weak moment maps to extend Noether's theorem from Hamiltonian mechanics by exhibiting a correspondence between multisymplectic conserved quantities and continuous symmetries on a multi-Hamiltonian system. We find that a weak moment map interacts with this correspondence in a way analogous to the moment map in symplectic geometry. We define a multisymplectic analog of the classical momentum and position functions on the phase space of a physical system by introducing momentum and position forms. We show that these differential forms satisfy generalized Poisson bracket relations extending the classical bracket relations from Hamiltonian mechanics. We also apply our theory to derive some identities on manifolds with a torsion-free G<SUB>2</SUB> structure.</FONT></P>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Thesis abstract</I>: In this thesis, we study differential operators on manifolds with torsion-free G<SUB>2</SUB>-structure. In particular, we use an identification of the spinor bundle S of such a manifold M with the bundle R &oplus; T<SUP>*</SUP>M to reframe statements regarding the Dirac operator in terms of three other first order differential operators: the divergence, the gradient, and the curl operators. We extend these three operators to act on tensors of one degree higher and study the properties of the extended operators. We use the extended operators to describe a Dirac bundle structure on the bundle T<SUP>*</SUP>M &oplus; (T<SUP>*</SUP>M &otimes; T<SUP>*</SUP>M) = T<SUP>*</SUP>M &otimes; (R &oplus; T<SUP>*</SUP>M) as well as its Dirac operator. We show that this Dirac operator is equivalent to the twisted Dirac operator D<SUB>T</SUB> defined using the original identification of S with R &oplus; T<SUP>*</SUP>M. As the two Dirac operators are equivalent, we use the T<SUP>*</SUP>M &oplus; (T<SUP>*</SUP>M &otimes; T<SUP>*</SUP>M) = T<SUP>*</SUP>M &otimes; (R &oplus; T<SUP>*</SUP>M) description of the bundle of spinor-valued 1-forms to examine the properties of the twisted Dirac operator D<SUB>T</SUB>. Using the extended divergence, gradient, and curl operators, we study the kernel of the twisted Dirac operator when M is compact and provide a proof that dim (ker D<SUB>T</SUB>) = b<SUP>2</SUP> + b<SUP>3</SUP>.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Thesis title</I>: "<B>Derived geometry and the integrability problem for G-structures</B>"</FONT>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Thesis abstract</I>: In this thesis, we study the integrability problem for G-structures. Broadly speaking, this is the problem of determining topological obstructions to the existence of principal G-subbundles of the frame bundle of a manifold, subject to certain differential equations. We begin this investigation by introducing general methods from homological algebra used to obtain cohomological obstructions to the existence of solutions to certain geometric problems. This leads us to a precise analogy between deformation theory and the formal integrability properties of partial differential equations. Along the way, we prove a differential-geometric analogue of a well-known result from derived algebraic geometry, as well as the identification of the infinitesimal generator of the natural S<SUP>1</SUP>-action corresponding to loop rotation with the de Rham differential. As a short corollary we obtain a natural isomorphism identifying the standard Gerstenhaber bracket with the Schouten bracket. These two results are well-known in derived algebraic geometry and are folklore in differential geometry, where we were unable to find an explicit proof in the literature. In the end, this machinery is used to provide what the author believes is a new perspective on the integrability problem for G-structures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Research essay abstract</I>: In 1956, John Milnor surprised the mathematical community by exhibiting examples of smooth manifolds that were homeomorphic to the 7-sphere but not diffeomorphic to it with its standard smooth structure; this was the first example of so-called "exotic" manifolds. This paper concerns itself with John Milnor's exotic spheres. After establishing some familiar terminology and notation, we will use Morse theoretical methods to provide a means of determining whether a given manifold is homeomorphic to the n-sphere. We shall then use tools from the theory of characteristic classes to define a quantity (Milnor's invariant) that distinguishes smooth structures on manifolds. We will give Milnor's original construction of his exotic spheres and show that they are all homeomorphic to the 7-sphere but that they are not all diffeomorphic to the 7-sphere with its standard smooth structure by means of computing Milnor's invariant for these spaces. This paper assumes familiarity with elementary smooth manifold theory and Riemannian geometry, including differential forms and integration thereof, familiarity with vector bundles, elements of algebraic topology and quaternion arithmetic. Facts pertaining to these topics are freely used throughout, though many definitions are repeated to establish terminology and notation.</FONT></P>

After that we will move on to the study of Lagrangian mean curvature flows. We will make the relevant definitions and prove the fundamental result that the Lagrangian condition is preserved along the mean curvature flow in K&auml;hler-Einstein manifolds, which started the extensive, and still ongoing, research on Lagrangian mean curvature flows. We will also define special Lagrangian submanifolds as calibrated submanifolds in Calabi-Yau manifolds. Finally, we will study the mean curvature flow of conormal bundles as submanifolds of C<SUP>n</SUP>. Using some tools developed recently, we will show that if a surface has strictly negative curvatures, then away from the zero section, the Lagrangian mean curvature flow starting from a conormal bundle does not develop Type I singularities.</FONT></P>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: Let M be a 2m-dimensional smooth manifold. A U(m)-structure on M is a pair consisting of a Riemannian metric g and an orthogonal almost complex structure J. When J is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection, this is the celebrated case of a Kahler manifold. The authors de la Ossa, Karigiannis, and Svanes have introduced a new class of U(m)-structures on 2m-dimensional real manifolds that satisfy a <I>second order</I> system of nonlinear PDEs. This class generalizes the Kahler class in that some analogous identities and Hodge theoretic relations continue to hold in a particular sense. It is of interest to seek explicit non-Kahler solutions to this system of PDEs. A natural starting point is to consider the cohomogeneity one case, where one imposes enough symmetry to reduce the system to a (still nonlinear) ODEs which one could hope to solve explicitly. Such an approach has had much success in other related geometric constructions.</P>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: The mean curvature flow is a flow of an isometrically immersed submanifold M inside an ambient Riemannian manifold X in the direction of the mean curvature vector field. The Ricci flow is an intrinsic flow of a metric on a Riemannian manifold M in the direction of (minus) the Ricci tensor. Let M be a Riemannian manifold and consider it as the zero section inside one of its tensor bundles X, such as the cotangent bundle X = T<SUP>*</SUP> M or the real canonical bundle X = &Lambda;<SUP>n</SUP> (T<SUP>*</SUP> M) where n = dim(M).</P>

<P>Using the Levi-Civita connection of M, there is a canonical Riemannian metric induced on X, which makes the zero section isometrically immersed. Therefore one can evolve M inside X by the mean curvature flow. For small time, this evolution M<SUB>t</SUB> will be canonically diffeomorphic to M using the exponential map on the mean curvature vector field. Pulling back via this diffeomorphism, the mean curvature flow of M in X thus induces an intrinsic flow of metrics on M.</P>

<P>The natural question is: what is this induced flow of metrics? If it is the Ricci flow, this gives a new interesting characterization of Ricci flow. If it is not the Ricci flow, this could be a new interesting canonical flow of metrics. Moreover, in the case when X = T<SUP>*</SUP> M, the zero section is Lagrangian, and mean curvature flow preserves the Lagrangian condition. The Lagrangian mean curvature flow is well-behaved. Similarly, when X = &Lambda;<SUP>n</SUP> (T<SUP>*</SUP> M), then M is a hypersurface in X. The hypersurface mean curvature flow is also well-behaved.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project title</I>: "<B>A Modern Characterization of the Walker Torsion Derivation</B>"</FONT>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: An almost complex manifold is a real 2m-dimensional smooth manifold together with a smooth endomorphism J of the tangent bundle that squares to minus the identity, allowing one to identity each tangent space with a complex m-dimensional vector space. In classical literature of the 1950's and 1960's, there exists a notion called the "torsional derivation" on an almost complex manifold, introduced by Walker and later expanded on by Willmore. This notion seems to have disappeared from the literature. Most likely, it is equivalent to an algebraic or Lie derivation on the bundle of forms as discussed by Michor et al in their text on "Natural Operations in Differential Geometry". The goal of this project is to understand what almost complex manifolds are, what algebraic and Lie derivations are, and to deduce whether or not the torsional derivation of Walker/Willmore is really a special case of one of these modern derivations. In the process, the students will also consider related questions for other vector-valued forms that are generalizations of almost complex structures, as arise, for example, in G<SUB>2</SUB> geometry.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project title</I>: "<B>Differential Invariants of Vector Cross Products</B>"</FONT>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: Vector cross products on manifolds were classified in the 1960's by Brown and Gray and fall into 4 types: the Hodge star operator, almost complex structures, and the 2-fold and 3-fold cross products associated to G<SUB>2</SUB> and Spin(7) structures, respectively. The covariant derivatives of the associated calibration forms measure the "torsion" of the geometric structure, and are obvious fundamental differential invariants. However, the cross products themselves are vector-valued differential forms, and as such one can compute their exterior covariant derivatives with respect to either the Levi-Civita connection or any other canonical connection in this context. These are additional differential invariants associated to such structures. It would be interesting to relate these to the classical torsion. If they are equal, this gives a new geometric characterization of torsion in this context. If they are not equal, it would be useful to interpret these new invariants in terms of classical invariants.</P>

<P>In a very closely related vein, for the case of almost complex structures one can define the notion of the "Nijenhuis tensor" which is a first order differential invariant that is defined using the Frolicher-Nijenhuis bracket of vector valued forms. There is an obvious generalization available here to the setting of the other vector cross products, and it is unclear how such generalized Nijenhuis tensors are related to the aforementioned classical torsion. Moreover, in analogy with the almost complex case, an investigation of these Nijenhuis tensors may provide a new geometric interpretation of torsion-free vector cross product structures in terms of integrable distributions of the tangent bundle.</P>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: The Marsden-Weinstein symplectic reduction theorem constructs a new symplectic manifold from an existing symplectic manifold M that admits a symplectic action by a Lie group G. The principal object involved in such a construction is the moment map, which is a map from M to g<SUP>*</SUP>, the dual of the Lie algebra of G.</P>

<P>The purpose of this project is to study to what extent such a reduction theory is possible in the context of manifolds with closed G<SUB>2</SUB> structures, which are generalizations of symplectic manifolds, admitting a closed nondegenerate 3-form rather than a 2-form. It appears that the moment map should be generalized to a g<SUP>*</SUP> valued 1-form rather than a 0-form. Moreover, the correct reduced space should just be an oriented Riemannian 3-manifold.

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: The Hopf fibrations in geometry are fibrations of spheres over projective spaces with spheres as the fibres. All the Hopf fibrations are related to the four finite dimensional normed real division algebras: the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, the quaternions H, and the octonions O. In particular the "classical" Hopf fibration of S<SUP>3</SUP> over S<SUP>2</SUP> = CP<SUP>1</SUP> with fibre S<SUP>1</SUP> is related to the quaternions.</P>

<P>Closely related to these algebras is the notion of a "cross product", which exists nontrivially only in dimensions 3 and 7, being determined by the imaginary part of quaternion or octonion multiplication, respectively. This cross product allows us to define the notion of the "curl" of a vector field in R<SUP>3</SUP> and R<SUP>7</SUP>.</P>

<P>The Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics in R<SUP>3</SUP> are a very complex nonlinear system of partial differential equations that have been studied for centuries. These equations involve the cross product and curl operations on R<SUP>3</SUP> in an essential way. Remarkably, an explicit exact solution in a certain special case is given by the classical Hopf fibration.</P>

<P>The aim of this project is to look for an analogue of the Navier-Stokes equations in 7 dimensional space, exploiting the existence of curl and cross product only in dimensions 3 and 7. Furthermore, the correct equations could possibly be found by demanding that one of the other Hopf fibrations, related to the octonions, provide an explicit exact solution. A potential byproduct may be a method to reduce solutions to the 7-d "Navier-Stokes" equations to obtain new exact solutions to the classical 3-d Navier-Stokes equations.</FONT></P>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: If a smooth two-dimensional oriented surface L is immersed into n-dimensional Euclidean space, one can define a "second fundamental form" which is a symmetric bilinear form on M whose values are normal vector fields to L. Then the trace of this bilinear form, with respect to the induced metric, gives a distinguished normal vector field H on L called the "mean curvature vector field". When this vector field vanishes, the surface is called "minimal" and one can show that it is a critical point of the area functional with respect to nearby variations.</P>

<P>In seven-dimensional space, there is a notion of a "cross product", with similar but slightly different properties to the usual cross product in three-dimensional space. This operation is intimately connected with the non-associative algebra of the octonions. This cross product allows one to pick out a <I>distinguished</I> normal vector field N to an oriented smooth surface L, immersed in seven-dimensional space. One can then consider the class of such surfaces for which <I>only</I> the component of the mean curvature vector field H in the direction of N vanishes. It may be possible to give a variational characterization of such surfaces. One can also attempt to explore other aspects of the extrinsic geometry of surfaces in seven-dimensional space that are adapted to this octonionic structure. For example, every oriented surface L in seven-dimensional space can be (in some sense uniquely) partially "thickened" to a so-called "associative submanifold", which is a class of calibrated submanifolds first defined by Reese Harvey and Blaine Lawson in 1982. These are of interest in M-theory and supergravity in modern physics. It would be interesting to see what consequences on the "thickened associative submanifold" arise from a priori conditions on the extrinsic geometry of the immersed surface L.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project title</I>: "<B>Generalized symmetries of the equations of calibrated geometry</B>"</FONT>

<P></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: There exists a general method for determining the (usually compact) Lie group G that is the "symmetry group" of a system of partial differential equations in the sense that it transforms solutions to solutions, and is like a Galois group for PDE's. For example, the symmetry group of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism is the Poincar&eacute; group of Minkowski space. If a system of PDE's is kth order, then this symmetry group G naturally extends to act on the kth jet bundle of the domain on which the equations are defined. Conversely, it sometimes happens that a group acts on the kth jet bundle, taking solutions to solutions, but it <I>does not</I> arise by extension of a group action on the domain. These are called "generalized symmetries" and usually are present in equations that exhibit qualities of "integrable systems."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One natural class of PDE's that occurs in geometry (inspired from physics) are the equations for calibrated submanifolds. In particular, the equations of special Lagrangian geometry do admit integrable systems interpretations, and therefore are particularly well suited to study by these techniques. We propose to look for generalized symmetries (of second order) for the special Lagrangian differential equations. This is a problem that can easily be solved (in the sense that we can determine unambiguously if such symmetries exist, and if they do, exactly what they are) during the summer term. This would be an interesting addition to the literature, at the interface of the fields of (i) symmetry groups of differential equations and (ii) calibrated geometry. If successful, we can use similar methods to study other calibrated geometries, which although they are only first order, tend to be much more nonlinear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Project abstract</I>: There is a deep relationship between minimal surfaces in R<SUP>n</SUP> and the theory of holomorphic functions, which is encoded by the classical Weierstrass representation of minimal surfaces in terms of holomorphic data. Understanding this relationship involves a mixture of complex analysis and the differential geometry of surfaces in Euclidean space. One interesting aspect of the Weierstrass representation is that it reveals the existence of a continuous family of "associated" minimal surfaces, parametrized by a circle. For example, this family continuously deforms the catenoid to the helicoid through minimal surfaces in R<SUP>3</SUP>. More recently, there has been intense interest in the study of "calibrated submanifolds" of Euclidean space, which are a special class of absolutely volume minimizing submanifolds defined by a first order non-linear differential equation. One type of calibrated submanifolds are the so-called "special Lagrangian" submanifolds, which are half-dimensional minimal submanifolds of a certain type in R<SUP>2n</SUP>. In this case, too, there is a circle family of such submanifolds. In the special case of surfaces in R<SUP>4</SUP>, it would be of interest to see how these two circle families of minimal (special Lagrangian) surfaces interact.</FONT></P>
